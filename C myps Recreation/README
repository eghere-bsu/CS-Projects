This program is a re-creation of the myps command found on UNIX-based
operating systems. This program was intended to run on BSU's onyx
Linux server; if you would like to simulate the conditions used to
test this program, use the same proc data found in the test_data
directory. Because this was compiled for Linux systems, compilation
for Windows and other operating systems may not be supported.
